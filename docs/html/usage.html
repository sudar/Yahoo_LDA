<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage">Using Y!LDA </a></h1><p>The main purpose of the Y!LDA framework is to allow you to infer the set of constituents that can be used to represent your documents as mixtures of the inferred constituents. This is also called learning a model for you corpus. This takes a significant amount of time. </p>
<p>Once a model has been learnt, you can also use it to find out what topics a new document is made up by using LDA in test mode. In this mode, you provide the learnt model as a parameter and use that model to infer the topic mixture for new documents. This is very fast compared to learning the model. This can be done in two ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli"></p>
<p class="endli">Batch mode: If you have a bunch of new documents for which you want to infer the topic mixture you use this mode. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"></p>
<p class="endli">Streaming mode: If you have documents which are to be streamed through the binary generating the topic mixture instantly, then this mode is for you. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between the two modes is that, in batch mode, the model is loaded for every batch of documents whereas in streaming mode, the model is loaded once and you can keep streaming the documents. In batch mode, you wait till all the documents in the batch are assigned topic mixtures whereas in streaming mode the topic mixture is assigned on a per document basis. In streaming mode, only a part of the model is loaded depending on how much memory you allocate for storing the model. However, we ensure that the model for the most important words (words that occurr more frequently) are loaded before loading the model for lesser frequent words till the allocated is memory is used up. The model loading time can be significant if its big. Hence the case for a streaming mode for those of you who do not want to bear the cost of loading a big model every time you want to infer topic mixtures on new documents. </p>
<p>Each of these is described in detail with an illustration below in the next subsection. </p>
<p>The other dimension to consider is the size of the data. If your corpus has a couple of million documents and you are willing to wait for a couple of days then all you need to know is the single machine setup where all the data is on a single machine (usually multi-core) and you run LDA on that machine. </p>
<p>If your corpus is larger than that, you have no choice but to resort to the multi-machine setup. Here you split your data amongst multiple machines (possibly each machine being a multi-core one) and run LDA on all those machines. The Y!LDA framework currently provides a hadoop based distributed LDA mechanism that uses a custom implemented distributed hash table. The framework provides hadoop-streaming scripts that do the entire thing (splitting, training, testing) in a distributed fashion on the hadoop cluster backed by the HDFS as the distributed file system where your data is stored. If you do not have a hadoop cluster at your disposal, we currently do not provide any scripts to run things automatically. You will have to distribute the data manually, copy the binary version, if its a homogenous setup, else install and run the framework on all the nodes containing data and finally execute binaries to merge the distributed parts of the model. We will only detail the steps to achieve them. Perhaps, one can contribute some scripts back so that this can be done automatically! </p>
